# Spring Security testing example repo

In this repo I've collected som examples of testing methods that you can use to
test your spring security configuration

The example uses a centralized Spring Security configuration that's described inside  
`SecurityConfig.kt`.

## Example coverage

- Basic auth: - [x]
- JWT: - [ ]
